# logic-minimization
# Objective: 
The objective of this project is to make you more familiar with the Quine-McCluskey Logic Minimization algorithm.

# Project Description:
a) [80 Points] A computer program in C/C++ (or a language of your choice; get Dr. Shalan’s approval first) will be
developed to accomplish the following tasks:
1. [10 Points] Read in (and validate) a Boolean function given as:
a. A SoP (for example: abc + a’b’c), or
b. A PoS (for example: (a + c)(d’ + e)
Assume that the variable name is a single Latin letter starting from “a”. Think about the checkers needed to
validate the input and list them in your report.
2. [10 Points] Print the truth table of the function as well as the canonical SoP and PoS.
3. [20 Points] Generate and print all prime implicants (PIs). For each PI show the minterms it covers as well as its
binary representation.
4. [15 Points] Using the PIs generated in part 2, obtain and print all the essential prime implicants EPIs(as Boolean
expressions).
5. [5 Pts] Print the minterms that are not covered by the essential PIs.
6. [10 Points, Bonus] Solve the PI table and print the minimized Boolean expression of the Boolean function using
the 3-step heuristic discussed in the lecture.
7. [5 Pts] Draw the K-Map showing the solution (up to 4 variables)
8. [5 Pts] Draw the logic circuit of the minimized function (up to 10 variables); you may use

# Notes:
• The Boolean function is up to 10 variables.
• Error checking is required to be implemented into your program
